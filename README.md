I used Flask to build a portfolio site. This site is live on https://yifang-guo.duckdns.org/!

## Content

- ✅ A photo of myself to the website
- ✅ An "About me" section to the website.
- ✅ My previous work experiences
- ✅ My hobbies (including images)
- ✅ My current/previous education
- ✅ A map of all the cool locations/countries I visited
- ✅ A new page to display hobbies.
- ✅ A menu bar that dynamically displays other pages in the app
- ✅ A timeline post page

## Getting Started

You need to do all your progress here.

## Installation

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed

Create and activate virtual environment using virtualenv

```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create a .env file using the example.env template (make a copy using the variables inside of the template)

Start flask development server

```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

You should get a response like this in the terminal:

```
❯ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You'll now be able to access the website at `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` in the browser!
